### Stability

#### Game stability

The original iBlast Moki games were for the most part stable, except for the level editor, where I (seanpm2001) noted that the level editor would frequently crash upon performing certain edits, or editing for more than an hour at a time. The crash would only erase a small amount of progress.

With iBlast, I have a focus on stability. The level editor should not crash, and if it does, it should crash as infrequently as possible.
