#### General overview of the level editor

Level editor

The level editor is the built-in tool in the iBlast and iBlast Moki games. It allows the creation and testing of levels in the game. Level editors are nearly limitless, the limitation is the size of the data file, and time it takes to go through the level.

The level editor offers the ability to preview and test levels, and also upload and share them with other iBlast players. Items for the level editor are unlocked as you progress through the main game campaign.

The level editor is by default in a Gr√¶y grid, but upon previewing, the region can be set, and the level can be previewed and tested in full color.

The level editor contains many elements.

With the level editor, you can choose how many puzzle pieces can be used to complete the level.
