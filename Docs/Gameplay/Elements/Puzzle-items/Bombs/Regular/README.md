## Gameplay elements

### Puzzle items / Bombs

#### Regular bomb

![Bomb image unavailable](/)

The bomb is a puzzle element that blasts the Moki. Despite being explosive, it does not harm the Moki. It also does not break objects. The bomb can be set to go off after a certain amount of time, clearing objects and pushing the Moki forward or backwards. It is the first and main puzzle element in the set of games. It is present in all iBlast and iBlast Moki games.

A certain number of bombs are available per level, so they must be used strategically to get the Moki to the portal in the shortest time possible.

The size of the bomb cannot be changed, neither can any of the other puzzle elements. The size is fixed
