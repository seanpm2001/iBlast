![Icon unavailable](/)

iBlast is the spiritual successor to iBlast Moki, a 2009 puzzle video game by the now defunct French video game studio Godzilab. iBlast is a recreation of the original game, with a focus on open source, stability, and cross platform play.

In the game, the player must use puzzle strategies to get the Moki to the portal at the end of the level to send it back home. The game also features a level editor.
