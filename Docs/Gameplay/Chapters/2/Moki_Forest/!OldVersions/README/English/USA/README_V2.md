### Chapters in iBlast 2

#### Moki Forest

Moki Forest is the first chapter of iBlast Moki 2/iBlast 2. It is basically the game tutorial chapter. The environment is a grassy forest area, where simple puzzles are implemented to teach the player the basics of the game. It is followed by the Red Desert. Also, upon 100% completion of the chapter (getting all 60 stars) you can unlock the forgotten woods chapter (which only contains 5 levels)

The regular bomb is the first puzzle item in this chapter. This puzzle introduces the first 4 puzzle elements:

1. Regular bomb
2. Speed bomb
3. Jump bomb
4. Glue bomb
