Unofficial name. The jump/bounce bomb is a puzzle element that adds bouncy pink liquid to the area where it explodes. Despite being explosive, it does not harm the Moki. The bomb can be set to go off after a certain amount of time, causing the bounce effect. Unlike the normal bomb, the jump bomb cannot push objects through its explosive impact. It is the third puzzle element in iBlast Moki 2/iBlast 2. It is present in iBlast Moki 2/iBlast 2, 3, and 3D. When objects touch it, they jump upwards or downwards, depending on the direction they are in upon touching the bouncy pink substance.

A certain number of jump bombs are available per level, so they must be used strategically to get the Moki to the portal in the shortest time possible.

The size of the jump bomb cannot be changed, neither can any of the other puzzle elements. The size is fixed
