#### iBlast 2

![Icon unavailable](/)

iBlast 2 is the spiritual successor to iBlast Moki 2, a 2011 puzzle video game by Godzilab. iBlast 2 is a recreation of the original second game, with a focus on open source, stability, and cross platform play.

The game has the same objectives as iBlast Moki 1, but features new regions, new graphics, new puzzle elements (such as the glue bomb, paint bomb, and speed bombs) and more. As like the first game, the game features a level editor.
