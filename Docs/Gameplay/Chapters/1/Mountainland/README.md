## Gameplay

### Chapters in iBlast 1

#### Mountainland

Mountainland is the fourth chapter of iBlast Moki 1/iBlast. It is a snowy mountain level, where the snow has no effect on gameplay. The environment is a light area, where puzzles are implemented without much tutorial help. The chapter is preceded by Waterland and is succeeded by Induland.

The rubber balloon and led piece are introduced in this chapter. The giant Moki also appears on the last level of the chapter, the same as in waterland.
