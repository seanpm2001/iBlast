## Gameplay elements

### Puzzle items / Bombs

#### Speed bomb

![Speed Bomb image unavailable](/)

Unofficial name. The speed/haste bomb is a puzzle element that adds slippery orange liquid to the area where it explodes. Despite being explosive, it does not harm the Moki. The bomb can be set to go off after a certain amount of time, causing the slippery effect. Unlike the normal bomb, the speed bomb cannot push objects through its explosive impact. It is the second puzzle element in iBlast Moki 2/iBlast 2. It is present in iBlast Moki 2/iBlast 2, 3, and 3D. When objects touch it, they accelerate forward or backwards, depending on the direction they are in upon touching the slippery orange substance.

A certain number of speed bombs are available per level, so they must be used strategically to get the Moki to the portal in the shortest time possible.

The size of the speed bomb cannot be changed, neither can any of the other puzzle elements. The size is fixed
