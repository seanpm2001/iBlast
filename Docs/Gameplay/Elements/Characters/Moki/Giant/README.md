The Giant Moki is a type of Moki that appears in iBlast/iBlast Moki 1, iBlast 3 and iBlast 3D. It is a giant version of the Moki that is heavier than the Jello Moki. Unlike the Jello Moki, it cannot change shape. It usually appeared on the final level of chapters 3 and up on the original iBlast Moki game. It is not present in iBlast 2/iBlast Moki 2. It only comes in 1 variation (brown)

The size of the Moki cannot be changed. The size is fixed.
