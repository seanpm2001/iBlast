### Puzzle items / Portal

#### Portal

![Portal image unavailable](/)

The portal is the end goal of each level. Only 1 portal can be placed per level. All Mokis must enter the portal to complete the level.

The size of the portal can be changed, but it does have a small size limit and a large size limit. The smallest size is 1/4 of the size of a normal Moki (which all Mokis can still fit in 1 at a time) while the maximum size is about the size of 256 jelly/large Mokis.

The portal will disappear once all Mokis enter it.

The portal has a distinctive red color, and is an animated object.
