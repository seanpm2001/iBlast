Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of June 23rd 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

# iBlast
A recreation of the award winning mobile games iBlast Moki and iBlast Moki 2, as the apps are no longer updates (they no longer work as of Android 7.0 and iOS 11) I also want to build on the concept, and also provide an open-source, and less buggy version of the games, plus a new version that is fan-made.

***

## About

See above. This is a recreation of the iBlast Moki 1 and 2 games by Godzilab, which no longer receive updates, and don't work on 2016 and newer Android/iOS devices. Along with the recreation, I want to build onto the concept, and provide an open-source, elss buggy version of the games (trust me, the original games were pretty buggy, spending long enough editing a level, or just playing the game, I would typically receive a crash, back in 2011-2014, on iOS 6) this version is going to be fuzz-tested to try and mitigate this problem. This version will also be free, instead of USD $1.99/USD $2.99 per game.

***

## Builds

There are no public builds of this game yet.

## Development pause

Development of this project first paused on 2022, August 6th, with one small delay in the pause on 2022, November 18th, where I created a documentation repository.

On 2025, Saturday, June 21st. I received an email about the development of the project, which spurred some interest again.

Less than a month later, on 2025, Wednesday, July 16th, development resumed, with the creation of an overworld data repository, followed by updates to the main iBlast repository the next day (2025, Thursday, July 17th)

A major hurdle in the development of iBlast is a lack of a proper reference. I am still unable to find an `*.ipa` or `*.apk` file for iBlast Moki and iBlast Moki 2. I hope to find one eventually. I just don't have a lot to go off of as a development reference, so development is hard/impossible right now.

***

## Desired development resources

- [ ] A copy of iBlast Moki (2009) (either APK or IPA, hopefully both)
- [ ] A copy of iBlast Moki 2 (2011) (either APK or IPA, hopefully both)
- [x] A copy of iBlast Moki (2009) soundtrack (received via Bandcamp)
- [x] A copy of iBlast Moki 2 (2011) soundtrack (received via Bandcamp)
- [ ] Some gameplay videos of iBlast Moki (2009)
- [ ] Some gameplay videos of iBlast Moki 2 (2009)

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
