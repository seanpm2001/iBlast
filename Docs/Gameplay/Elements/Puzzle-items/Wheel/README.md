## Gameplay elements

### Puzzle items

#### Wheel

![Wheel image unavailable](/)

The wheel is a puzzle element that connects to rope, or goes independent of other puzzle objects. It is used to carry/push Mokis and other objects. It can be connected via rope. The wheel is indestructable, with the exception of falling into the void, or getting stuck. It was introduced in the second iBlast Moki game in the last chapter (steam city) and is present in iBlast 2, 3, 3D, and iBlast Moki 2.

The size of the wheel cannot be changed. The size is fixed. The balloon also only comes in 1 color scheme. The wheel moves automatically, and goes forward. It cannot be put on a timer, and it cannot stop spinning.

Sticky bombs can be used on wheels, and wheels can speed up, bounce, or get stuck from sticky/paint bombs.
