# Soundtrack in ALAC format

Currently, the soundtrack is sold separately, as I don't have Romain Gauthier or Godzilabs permission to redistribute the soundtrack.

You can buy it here: [Bandcamp link](https://ninomojo.bandcamp.com/album/iblast-moki-2)

Note: album is titled `iBlast Moki 2` but the last 3 tracks contain the music from iBlast Moki 1. Album price is $2.99 USD (Â£2.14, 3.77 CAD, 2.74 CHF, [etc](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%242.99+to+pounds&t=canonical&ia=currency)) you can only listen a limited number of times before having to purchase it.
