## Gameplay

### Chapters in iBlast 1

#### Blowingland

Blowingland is the second chapter of iBlast Moki 1/iBlast. It is a night level. The environment is a dark area, where puzzles are implemented without tutorial help. This chapter heavily involves objects that can be moved by bombs. Mokis will also sometimes generate in Halloween format upon loading the level. The chapter is preceded by Mokiland, and is succeeded by waterland.

The regular bomb is the only puzzle item in this chapter. The previous chapter is the same way.
