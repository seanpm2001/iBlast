A recreation of the award winning mobile games iBlast Moki and iBlast Moki 2, as the apps are no longer functional (they no longer work as of Android 7.0 (2016-2019) and iOS 11(2017-2018)) I also want to build on the concept, and also provide an open-source, and less buggy version of the games, plus a new version that is fan-made.
