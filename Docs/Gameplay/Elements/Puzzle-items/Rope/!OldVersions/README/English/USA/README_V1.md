## Gameplay elements

### Puzzle items

#### Rope

![Rope image unavailable](/)

The rope is a puzzle element that connects other puzzle objects, along with non-fixed level objects and even the Moki itself to another. Despite tying the mouth closed, it does not harm the Moki. It is one of the first puzzle elements in the game series, and is present in all iBlast and iBlast Moki games.

A certain number of rope pieces are available per level, so they must be used strategically to get the Moki to the portal in the shortest time possible.

The size of the rope cannot be changed, neither can any of the other puzzle elements, although it can be stretched out a certain distance. The size is mostly fixed.
