### Chapters in iBlast 1

#### Induland

Induland is the fifth chapter of iBlast Moki 1/iBlast. It is an industrial city level. The environment is a lit area, where puzzles are implemented without much tutorial help. This chapter heavily involves air and mechanical physics. The chapter is preceded by Mountainland, and is succeeded by Mokitozer.

No new puzzle elements are introduced in this chapter. Additionally, the giant Moki does not appear on any level.
