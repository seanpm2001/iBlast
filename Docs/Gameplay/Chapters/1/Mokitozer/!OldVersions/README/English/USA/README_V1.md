## Gameplay

### Chapters in iBlast 1

#### Mokitozer

Mokitozer is the sixth and final chapter of iBlast Moki 1/iBlast. It is set inside the stomach of the great Mokitozer. The environment is a lit area, where organs, eyes, and other bodily fluids are around, but can't be interacted with. Puzzles are implemented without much tutorial help. This chapter heavily involves the wheel physics, along with all puzzle elements combined. The chapter is preceded by Induland, and is succeeded by the completion of the game.

The final puzzle item for the game (the wheel) is introduced in this chapter. The giant Moki also appears on the last level.
