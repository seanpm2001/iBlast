#### Bonus flower

The bonus flower is a collectible item that is usually placed on levels in difficult spots to encourage the puzzle solver to try unique ways of solving. A level is only 100% complete once all bonus flowers are collected (once a Moki touches them) there is a limit of 256 flowers per level in iBlast/iBlast Moki and iBlast 2/iBlast Moki 2, but there is no limit in iBlast 3 and iBlast 3D.

Usually, official levels only contain 0-4 bonus flowers. If a level contains flowers, is completed, but not all flowers (or no flowers) are collected, the player with receive a silver medal if they completed the level quickly, and a bronze medal if they completed the level slowly.

The size of the flower cannot be changed. The size is fixed. It is as big as a bolt. It is available in only 1 color scheme (white pedals, yellow core) it is an animated item.
